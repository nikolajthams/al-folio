I am a Quantitative Researcher at [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.co.uk) in London.
Previously, I was a PhD student of Statistics at the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/) with [Prof. Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/).

I have two bachelor degrees in Mathematics and Mathematical Economics and a master degree in Statistics, all from the University of Copenhagen. During my studies, I have spent semesters at University of Aarhus, University of Hong Kong, ETH ZÃ¼rich and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

My research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning and Mathematical Statistics, including causal inference, graphical models, optimization and dynamical systems.
