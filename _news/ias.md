In our new paper __*Invariant Ancestry Search*__, we learn causal ancestors by using heterogeneity in data. 
We test sets for minimally invariance, and show that the union of minimaly invariant sets is ancestral.
Our method retains level guarantees also when dimensionality is too large, to exhaustively search all sets, and we apply our method in a genetic dataset with 6000 genes. [[PDF]](assets/pdf/ias.pdf)
