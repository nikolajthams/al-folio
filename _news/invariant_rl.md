When dealing with policy data from several environments, some predictors may be great in some environments, but not in others. In our new paper
__*Invariant Policy Learning*__, we show that learning invariant sets of predictors allows us to learn policies that generalize well to new environments. [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00808.pdf)
