My research visit at the [ClinicalML](http://clinicalml.org/) lab is coming to an end, and I have had a great time here! I'm very grateful to David Sontag for hosting me! <br>

Together with *Michael Oberst*, I have been working on an interesting project: __*Evaluating Robustness to Dataset Shift via Parametric Robustness Sets*__. We argue that considering bounded parametric shifts allow for interpreting the *worst-case* performance of a model, and we propose a second-order approximation of the loss under shift, which has a particularly pretty interpretation, when the shift occurs in an exponential family model.
