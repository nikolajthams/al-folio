What do you do if you observe data from a distribution `Q` but want to test a hypothesis about a different, but related, distribution `P`?
In our recent paper, __*Statistical Testing under Distributional Shifts*__, we show how to test hypotheses in `P` by applying a test in a auxiliary dataset drawn by weighted resampling. [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10821.pdf)
