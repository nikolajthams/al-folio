New paper __*Identifying Causal Effects using Instrumental Time Series: Nuisance IV and Correcting for the Past*__ online now! In this paper, we provide a structured treatment of instrumental variable (IV) methods in time series data, by showing that valid IV models can be identified by representing the time series as a finite graph. We emphasize the need for adjusting for past states of the time series, to get valid instruments, and develop _Nuisance IV_, a modification of IV estimators.
